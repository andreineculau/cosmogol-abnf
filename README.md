# Cosmogol ABNF

Cosmogol is a language to describe finite state machines.

The [IETF specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bortzmeyer-language-state-machines) has expired.

This repository brings some simplifications to the ABNF grammar, implementing some TODOs, along with other changes,
which might prove useful whenever the specification is revived.
